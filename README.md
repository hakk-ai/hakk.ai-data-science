# Submission Due Phase 2 - 20th June 2020

We aim to solve the Grab problem in [Microsoft Azure Virtual Hackathon](https://www.msazurevirtualhack.com/). The Grab challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/Feliren88/hakk.ai/blob/master/challenge%20guideline/Grab%20Challenge%20Guidelines%20-%20Phase%202.pdf)

[Presentation slides](https://github.com/hakk-ai/hakk.ai-data-science/blob/master/Document/hakk.ai%20presentation.pptx)

Our team consists of:
1. Vicky Feliren (Project Lead/Data Science)
2. Winson Wijaya (Data Science)
3. Ivan Wijaya (Data Science)
4. James Casia (Mobile App Developer)
5. Firnas Aleem (Software Engineer)

Traditional Machine Learning experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/hakk-ai/hakk.ai-data-science/blob/master/Modelling/Modelling_Feliren.ipynb)

Gradient Boosting experiment can be found [here](https://github.com/hakk-ai/hakk.ai-data-science/blob/master/Modelling/Modelling_GradientBoost_Ivan.ipynb)

Consistency test can be found [here](https://github.com/hakk-ai/hakk.ai-data-science/blob/master/Modelling/Modelling_MultipleScript%26Stacking_Ivan.ipynb). In this notebook, we also tried ensembling using both XGboost and LightGBM.

The deployed model is in [here](https://github.com/hakk-ai/hakk.ai-data-science/blob/master/Modelling/xgb_really_final.pkl)
